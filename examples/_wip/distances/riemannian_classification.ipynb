    "### Comparison of Riemannian Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Riemannian geometry offers methods for extracting features for classification from multichannel EEG signals, by treating functional connectivity matrices as points on a Riemannian manifold - a smooth, curved space where distances between points are defined by the geometry of the manifold rather than the linear geometry of Euclidean space. We demonstrate how to estimate pairwise connectivity matrices between EEG channels in both the time (covariance) and frequency (cross-spectral density) domains. Importantly, both forms are symmetric/hermitian positive definite and reside on a Riemannian manifold. Using Riemannian distances between matrices, we compare a number of classification algorithms from the [pyRiemann](https://pyriemann.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package."

    "\n",
    "The transformers take a collection of multivariate series of '(n_epochs, n_channels, n_timepoints)' and output functional connectivity matrices for each epoch, '(n_epochs, n_channels, n_channels)'. Specifically, we estimate covariance and cross-spectral density matrices. Since some of the classifiers used are only defined on real-valued domains, so we compute the magnitude of the cross-spectral densities, which takes the absolute value of the real part of the complex entries of the matrix. The pipeline first applies these transformers, then classifies the resulting matrices using Riemannian means and distances between matrices.
