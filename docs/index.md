# Welcome to __aeon-neuro__

`aeon-neuro` is package that unifies techniques for the classification of EEG time
series. Our goal is to present a simple and unified interface to a variety of EEG
classification problems that combine techniques from a range of domains that learn
from EEG signals.

We aim to develop this package following the principles of open science, and
reproducible research, as described in the [Turing Way](https://github.com/the-turing-way) and this package is based on [this template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template).

`aeon-neuro` is a companion package to the `aeon` toolkit. The main project webpage
and documentation is available at https://aeon-toolkit.org and the source code at
https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon.
