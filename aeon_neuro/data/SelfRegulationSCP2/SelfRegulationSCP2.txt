Data set 1b: Self-regulation of Slow Cortical Potentials

Datasets provided by University of Tuebingen.

Description of Experiments:
The datasets were taken from an artificially respirated ALS patient. The subject was asked to move a cursor up and down on a computer screen, while his cortical potentials were taken. During the recording, the subject received auditory and visual feedback of his slow cortical potentials (Cz-Mastoids).  Cortical positivity lead to a downward movement of the cursor on the screen.  Cortical negativity lead to an upward movement of the cursor.  Each trial lasted 8s.
During every trial, the task was visually and auditorily presented by a highlighed goal at the top (for negativity) or bottom (for positivity) of the screen from second 0.5 until second 7.5 of every trial.  In addition, the task ("up" or "down") was vocalised at second 0.5.
The visual feedback was presented from second 2 to second 6.5. Only this 4.5 second interval of every trial is provided for training and testing. The sampling rate of 256 Hz and the recording length of 4.5s results in 1152 samples per channel for every trial.
Trial structure overview:
Duration: 8 s, no inter trial intervals
task presentation: from 0.5 s to 7.5 s
feedback period: from 2.0 s to 6.5 s



Data:
Amplifier: PsyLab EEG8
A/D-converter: Computer Boards PCIM-DAS1602/16 bit
Amplitude range: +/-1000 µV
Sampling rate: 256 S/s
EEG data was taken from the following positions:
Channel 1: A1-Cz (10/20 system) (A1 = left mastoid)
Channel 2: A2-Cz
Channel 3: 2 cm frontal of C3
Channel 4: 2 cm parietal of C3
Channel 5: vEOG artifact channel to detect vertical eye movements
Channel 6: 2 cm frontal of C4
Channel 7: 2 cm parietal of C4
All values are in µVolt.
The EEG-values are not EOG-corrected.
Traindata_0.txt and Traindata_1.txt:

The train data contains  200 trials, 100 of each class which were recorded on the same day and permuted randomly.
There are 7 dimensions and the series are length 1152.

Test data contains 180 trials of test data.  This test data was recorded after the train data (during the same day) day.  The 180 trials belong to either class 0 or class 1.

Note that it is not clear if there is any information contained in this data set that is useful for the classification task. A view on the result suggests that it is not.
