This dataset was recorded from a normal subject during a no-feedback session. The subject sat in a normal chair, relaxed arms resting on the
table,
fingers in the standard typing position at the computer keyboard. The task was to press with the index and little fingers the corresponding
keys in a
self-chosen order and timing 'self-paced key typing'. The experiment consisted of 3 sessions of 6 minutes each. All sessions were conducted
on the
same day with some minutes break inbetween. Typing was done at an average speed of 1 key per second.

There are 316 train cases and 100 test cases. Each case is a recording of 28 EEG channels of 500 ms length each ending 130 ms before a
keypress.
This is downsampled at 100 Hz (as recommended) so eacxh channel consists of 50 observations. Channels are in the following order:
(F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, O1, O2).


Technical data
The recording was made using a NeuroScan amplifier and a Ag/AgCl electrode cap from ECI. 28 EEG channels were measured at positions of the
international 10/20-system (F, FC, C, and CP rows and O1, O2). Signals were recorded at 1000 Hz with a band-pass filter between 0.05 and 200
Hz.
